# central question: do people in this class clump by gender? 
# looking at a table-by-table basis - 4 people at each table 
# class composition is 14 men and 16 women 
# our null hypothesis is that people show up randomly while alternative is that people clump by gender 

# 0 is men (and there are 14 of them so zero is being repeated 14 times), and one is female 
dist <- c(rep(0, 14), rep(1, 16))

# using rbinom because there are just men and women

n <- 1000
